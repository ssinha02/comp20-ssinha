COMP 20 Fall 2014 Private Repo for Shivani Sinha

The purpose of this github repository was primarily to work on assignments for the course Comp20 at Tufts University. 
However now, it is a representation of what I have learned and the knowledge I have developed throughout this semester.
My favorite assignment this semester was Assignment 3.  I really enjoyed the whole process of being able to build something
and then call it my own at the end.  I appreciated the way Assignment 2 flowed into Assignment 3, and how the overarching
concepts of client and server side development were integrated into the two assignments.

This has been a rough semester in terms of my personal health.  Regardless, I think it is fair to say that I have grown
considerably in that time.  I came into this class not knowing the first thing about Web Programming and am leaving with
the ability to build and create from scratch.  Furthermore, I have grown as a student and learned how to utilize the 
resources available to me.  I don't think I truly understood how many resources were available to us as students from
TAs to the Internet.  I learned that it was okay to ask for help when needed, and developed a new perspective of what 
the real world will be like after college. 

My interest has always leaned towards biology and medicine, and I am interested to see how I can apply the development 
skills I have aquired towards creating medicine-related applications.

Many thanks to Ming for being so accommodating and patient this semester.  I truly appreciate your help and support.
