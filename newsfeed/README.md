I believe all aspects of Lab 7 have been implemented correctly. I was slightly unsure of the format for the timestamp,
but am displaying the number of milliseconds that have passed since January 1, 1970 using the Date.now() operation.

I received help debugging my code from Kate Wasynczuk.

This lab took me approximately 45 minutes.
