Lab 5 README
Shivani Sinha

Collaborated with Kate Wasynczuk

Time spent: ~1 hour

I have correctly implemented the given specifications for this assignment.
I have annotated the music video stanza by stanza using JavaScript.
I have used two images in my annotation: one within the first stanza and one that
stands on its own during the interlude.  The only portion of the html file that 
was modified is within <script></script>.
