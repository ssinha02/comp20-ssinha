I believe all necessary aspects of this assignment have been implemented correctly.

I collaborated with my partner, Kirk Jackson, and also briefly discussed possible security 
issues with Ming Chow.

I spent approximately 1 hour attempting to break Kirk's web application, and another hour
completing the write-up of my findings.
